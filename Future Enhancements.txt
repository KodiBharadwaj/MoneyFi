- Add api's through api gateway not through user service. Remove all.
- Replace Jpa & Jpql with ms sql queries and stored procedures through repository.
- add err0r codes to all controllers


Defects:
- In budget edit section, profile section, editing an income, even If I didn't do any changes, it is still getting toast with updated.
- When a service is failed or stopped working, it should show service unavailable, should not throw error.
- while deleting a transaction, the toast should display source name.
- in the confirm delete dialog box, it should show the income/expense/goal source name.
- if previous date is selected in income and expense, if that is empty and it is asked to add income. There in the dialog box, it should show that date, not current date.
- category section is not working properly. Try remove or implement other.
- if there are no budgets, it showing error in console . But income and expense are not showing.


cleared defects:
- same source and same category duplicate transaction should not allowed.
- update charts after deleting a transaction (income, expense)
- after having income and expenses, if we delete previous incomes then it will show -ve. which is not possible.
May be some conditionals are required when deleting,updating an income and make one income as primary and for the editing income, when editing the income, it should check the total expense of that month. if the income is still greater then only able to edit.
