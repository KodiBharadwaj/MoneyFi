Defects:
- When a service is failed or stopped working, it should show service unavailable, should not throw error.

  current date.
- category section is not working properly. Try remove or implement other.
- In two browsers, if i open the same account, both are working.


cleared defects:
- same source and same category duplicate transaction should not allowed.
- update charts after deleting a transaction (income, expense)
- after having income and expenses, if we delete previous incomes then it will show -ve. which is not possible.
- May be some conditionals are required when deleting updating an income when editing the income, it should check the total expense of that month. if the      
  income is still greater then only able to edit.
- Editing an income and expense, even If I didn't do any changes, it is still getting toast with updated.
- In the confirm delete dialog box, it should show the income/expense/goal source name.
- It's allowing to create a goal with target amount less than current amount
- while deleting a transaction(income/expense/goal), the toast should display source name.
- If there are no budgets, it showing error in console . But income and expense are not showing.
