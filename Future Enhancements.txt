Project MoneyFi:

Major Corrections:
- Implement soft delete and set 30 day expiration for the deleted transactions(Income, Expense).
- Replace Jpa & Jpql with ms sql queries and stored procedures through repository.
- Error handling in both backend and frontend.
- Add api's through api gateway not through user service. Remove all.
- Pdf/Excel export of the data of the user (If possible any uploads)
- Google authentication
- try adding reports



Minor Corrections:
- @operation(summary = "...") replace all comments with this in all controller files.
- Ask confirmation before deleting a goal/income/expense etc in the frontend.
- Replace sessionStorage with secureSessionStorage in the frontend.
- Api calls should come under network section in console.
- Implement logout issue in the backend too.



Defects:
- In budget edit section, profile section, even If I didn't do any changes, it is still getting toast with updated.
